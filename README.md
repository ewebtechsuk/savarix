# ressapp

This repository contains a Laravel application.

## Running Artisan commands

Use Laravel's command-line tool by executing `php artisan` from the project root (the same directory that contains the `artisan` file). Examples:

```bash
php artisan list
php artisan migrate
```

## Running tests

Tests are written with PHPUnit. After installing dependencies via Composer, run the test suite from the project root:

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

If PHPUnit is installed globally you can simply run `phpunit`.
